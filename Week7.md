Part 2:

Edit in VSCode: 40 seconds
Edit in Vim : Roughly 25 seconds

Question 1:Which of these two styles would you prefer using if you had to work on a program that you were running remotely, and why?
For now, I am more familiar with using VSCode so I would prefer using it to run my program. It might not be time-efficient and difficult in switch files like vim but once I get used with all the commands in vim, I would definitely prefer vim to maximize time-efficency.

Question 2: What about the project or task might factor into your decision one way or another? (If nothing would affect your decision, say so and why!)
With a larger project, I will prefer to use Visual Studio Code. It's easier to view and switch files in the folders comparing to Vim.
